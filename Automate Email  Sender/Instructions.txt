1. Convert PDF to Excel
Convert a PDF file (presumably containing contact details) into an Excel file.
Rename the Excel file to contacts.xlsx.

2. Resume File
Ensure the resume is in PDF format.
Rename the file to resume.pdf.

3. Automation Code Setup
You have two Python scripts:

sender.py:
Sends emails to the list in contacts.xlsx.
The email body can be customized directly in the script.

validate.py:
Validates email addresses before sending.
Checks if the email exists or can receive mail.
